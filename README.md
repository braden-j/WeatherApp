## Resources Used

- **[ChatGPT]** 
  - I utilized ChatGPT for guiding/clarifiying questions throughout the development of my weather app UI. I started off by asking for a general HTML and CSS layout to start with and then I built off and modify that to achieve my final product. One specific question I had was about creating the forecast components. I also couldn't get the weather icon/info on the top left to align correctly so it helped me fixed that with flex.
